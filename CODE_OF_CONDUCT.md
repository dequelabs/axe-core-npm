## Introduction

Deque is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and welcoming virtual environment for contributors.

We created this policy not because we anticipate bad behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces a level of respect among contributors and because having a code of conduct provides us with clear avenues to correct our virtual culture should it ever stray from that course.

## Code of Conduct Policy

We expect all contributors to Deque open-source projects to uphold the principles of this Code of Conduct. We do not tolerate disruptive or disrespectful behavior, messages, images, or interactions by any participant, in any form.

We will not tolerate harassment or discrimination based on age, ancestry, color, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

## Enforcement and Reporting

Contributors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately; regardless, Deque reserves the right to remove or block anyone from any repository at the discretion of Deque employees.

If you have any concerns, please contact a code-owner or other Deque employee via direct message on the [axe Community Slack](https://accessibility.deque.com/axe-community) with details about the nature of the concern.
