# @axe-core/reporter-earl

This project is a reporter for [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core). When used as part of an axe-core run, it will produce results using the [Evaluation And Reporting Language (EARL) 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/). The reporter uses [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) to serialise the RDF data.

Previous versions of this program were maintained at [dequelabs/axe-reporter-earl](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-reporter-earl).

## Installation

To install Axe-reporter-earl, with NPM, run:

```shell
npm install @axe-core/reporter-earl
```

## Usage

The EARL reporter can be passed to axe, either as part of configuration or as part of the run:

```js
import reporter from '@axe-core/reporter-earl';
// Define the reporter through axe.configure
axe.configure({ reporter });
axe.run().then(earlResults => console.log(earlResults));
```

```js
import reporter from '@axe-core/reporter-earl';
// Use the reporter in a single axe.run call
axe.run({ reporter }).then(earlResults => console.log(earlResults));
```

## Format

The repoter format should look something like this:
